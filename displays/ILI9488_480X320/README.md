In this repository, you will find examples tested and verified by me. However, to ensure everything works correctly, assemble the hardware according to the attached diagram and download and install the "TFT_eSPI" library from this repository. It must be this exact library with all its files; otherwise, it wonâ€™t work. Alternatively, download it from the provided "link" and modify the "user_setup.h" file according to the file of the same name also attached in this repository.
